**Kaggle** is an AirBnB for Data Scientists – this is where they spend  their nights and weekends. It’s a crowd-sourced platform to attract,  nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world  to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics  problems. It has over 536,000 active members from 194 countries and it  receives close to 150,000 submissions per month. Started from Melbourne, Australia Kaggle moved to Silicon Valley in 2011, raised some 11  million dollars from the likes of Hal Varian (Chief Economist at  Google), Max Levchin (Paypal), Index and Khosla Ventures and then  ultimately been acquired by the Google in March of 2017. Kaggle is the  number one stop for data science enthusiasts all around the world who  compete for prizes and boost their Kaggle rankings. There are only 94  Kaggle Grandmasters in the world to this date.

Do you know that most data scientists are only theorists and rarely  get a chance to practice before being employed in the real-world? Kaggle solves this problem by giving data science enthusiasts a platform to  interact and compete in solving real-life problems. The experience you  get on Kaggle is invaluable in preparing you to understand what goes  into finding feasible solutions for big data. 

Kaggle enables data scientists and other developers to engage in  running machine learning contests, write and share code, and to host  datasets. The types of data science problems posted on Kaggle can be  anything from attempting to predict cancer occurrence by examining  patient records to analyzing sentiment to evoke by movie reviews and how this affects audience reaction. 
 Different sources post projects on this trailblazing platform. While  some are just for educational purposes and fun brain exercises, others  are genuine issues that companies are trying to solve. Kaggle makes the  environment competitive by awarding prizes and rankings for winners and  participants. The prizes are not only monetary but can also include  attractive rewards such as jobs or free products from the company  hosting the competition. 
 Monetary prices are exciting to most Kagglers. For instance, Home Depot  was offering a winning prize of a whopping $40,000 in search of an  algorithm to improve search results on homedepot.com. For most data  science enthusiasts, this innovative website is not only a monetary  resource, but it is also an indispensable learning tool that helps  improve the experience, gain knowledge, elevate and enhance the skills,  and learn from mistakes by resubmitting the code. It is the perfect  platform to practice consistently. 

The Kaggle community is growing fast. There are currently over one  million Kaggle members (Kagglers). This data community has submitted  above four million learning models to different competitions. Kaggle  users have shared over one thousand datasets, more than 170,000 forum  posts and over 250 kernels. According to the founder, this incredibly  fast growth can be attributed to high-quality content, data, and code  shared by Kagglers.

Most Kaggle users are committed and active hence the 4,000 forum  posts per month and more than 3,500 competition submissions on a daily  basis. This platform is the place to be for data scientists and machine  learning engineers worldwide.

#####  Why is Kaggle Worth Your Time?

> 1. Interesting and challenging projects where contributors can learn and practice
>    Kaggle competitions involve solving challenging and interesting  problems. Companies post projects to numerous contributors. It  especially a great place for beginners who are just trying to break into the data science field. Aside from the competitions that are open to  the general public, Kaggle also has private competitions which are only  open to top rated participants (Kaggle Masters). 
> 2. Insightful discussions with industry leaders and learned experts
>    Apart from the projects, Kaggle also consists of live discussions  between numerous people on the platform. Such forums are very  interesting, stimulating and informative. Through these discussions, you can either seek advice from others or offer advice to people who are  dealing with issues you understand
> 3. Kaggle offers its audience a chance to get into the biggest data science community in the world
>    This platform is trusted by some of the largest data science companies  of the world such as Walmart, Facebook and Winton Capital. On Kaggle,  data scientists get exposure and a chance to work on problems faced by  big companies in real-time. While it is not a guarantee, there is always the chance that the company will be impressed enough to recruit.

##### How Kaggle Works

> The host of the competition is in-charge of preparing the data and  preparing a detailed description of the problem at hand. To make it more convenient for hosts, Kaggle offers an additional consulting service  that can help prepare data and describe the problem in the best possible format. 
>
> The participants who compete for projects submit their models with a  variety of techniques. All the work is shared on the platform through  detailed Kaggle scripts with the intention of inspiring new ideas to  achieve better benchmarks. In most Kaggle competitions, submissions are  scored immediately and clearly summarised publicly on the live  leader-board.
>
> Competitors are not given a single chance at solving a problem.  Before the deadline expires, the competitors are allowed to make  revisions on their submissions as they deem fit. This fuels competitors’ motivations to consistently innovate, be creative and polish their  skills to produce better, elegant and effective solutions. Allowing for  revisions elevates the level of accuracy and precision as well.  
>
> When the deadline for a competition expires, the host pays the prize  money to the winner. Hosts have the sole ownership and royalty-free  license to use the winning entry any way they want with all intellectual property. 
>  How the Winner is Selected
>
> The host will screen participants depending on where they are placed  on the leader-board. Their final scripts and also the content of the  scripts submitted. Most hosts take the prerogative to reach out to  strong contenders and arrange interviews.

##### Do Kaggle Projects have any Real impact

> One of its biggest and most recognized projects is one by Heritage  Health which offered a remarkable cash price of $3 million. Competitions hosted on Kaggle have had far-reaching impacts such as enhancing and  enabling state of the art HIV/AIDS research and improving traffic  forecasting. 
>  Several informative academic papers have been written and published on  the basis of the findings generated through Kaggle contributions.  Essentially Kaggle has given companies the opportunity to seek solutions from the best data scientist in the world and to have external pairs of eyes to look at the problems they are trying to solve.
